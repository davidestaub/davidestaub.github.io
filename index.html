          I am Davide Staub, a PhD student at Imperial College London working in the
          <a href="https://scalable-sciml-lab.org/" target="_blank">Scalable Scientific Machine Learning Lab</a>
          under the supervision of Dr.&nbsp;Ben Moseley. My research focuses on
          harnessing machine learning and physics to build differentiable tools for
          reconstructing the three‑dimensional structure of exoplanet atmospheres from
          JWST observations.
          Before starting my PhD, I spent a year at the HomanLab within the
          Psychiatric University Hospital of Zürich, where we combined brain imaging
          and large language models to understand how the brain processes
          narratives.

        <h3>Current research</h3>
        <p>
          My PhD project aims to develop a single, differentiable pipeline that
          converts all available JWST observations of a hot Jupiter—thermal
          emission spectra, phase curves, eclipses and transmission spectra—into a
          unified three‑dimensional temperature field \(T(\lambda, \phi, p)\). The
          map uses a low‑dimensional spherical‑harmonics basis for horizontal
          structure and smooth vertical modes, and the inversion is regularised
          using physically motivated terms such as energy balance, global
          radiative closure and hydrostatic consistency.  This
          framework treats the atmosphere as a shared state that must
          simultaneously explain observations across multiple viewing geometries.

        <h3>Previous work</h3>
        <p>
          While working at the HomanLab in Zürich, I studied how the brain tracks
          the flow of meaning during natural story listening.  We derived two
          annotation‑free signals from a large language model: a <em>drift</em>
          index that captures gradual semantic accumulation and a <em>shift</em>
          index that marks discrete event boundaries.  These
          signals were fit to high‑resolution fMRI data from a participant
          listening to crime stories.  The shift predictions were robust in the
          peri‑Sylvian auditory–language cortex (e.g., Heschl’s gyrus, planum
          temporale/polare and superior temporal gyrus), whereas the drift
          responses were comparatively weaker there but stronger in higher‑order
          hubs such as the angular gyrus, precuneus and posterior cingulate.  This
          dissociation suggests that auditory‑language regions are dominated by
          boundary signals, while default‑mode network hubs preferentially track
          slow context integration.

          Below are brain maps showing where each signal explained neural
          responses.  Bright colours indicate regions with stronger effects.

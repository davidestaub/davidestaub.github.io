          I am Davide Staub, a PhD student at Imperial College London working in the
          <a href="https://scalable-sciml-lab.org/" target="_blank">Scalable Scientific Machine Learning Lab</a>
          under the supervision of Dr.&nbsp;Ben Moseley. My research focuses on
          harnessing machine learning and physics to build differentiable tools for
          reconstructing the three‑dimensional structure of exoplanet atmospheres from
          JWST observations.
          Before starting my PhD, I spent a year at the HomanLab within the
          Psychiatric University Hospital of Zürich, where we combined brain imaging
          and large language models to understand how the brain processes
          narratives.

          <strong>Graduate Teaching Assistant, Imperial College London:</strong> I help deliver the MSc Deep Learning
          course at Imperial College London.  This involves running tutorials, answering students’ questions
          and supporting practical exercises on topics such as neural network fundamentals, optimisation
          and modern architectures.

          <strong>Lecturer, ETH Zürich – Space Data:</strong> I teach the final third of the
          <a href="https://eaps.ethz.ch/en/studies/master/space-systems.html" target="_blank">Space&nbsp;Data course</a>
          in the Master in Space Systems programme at ETH Zürich.  My block introduces convolutional neural
          networks and U‑Net architectures for denoising images of the Moon’s permanently shadowed regions (PSRs).
          These techniques build on the HORUS framework developed by Ben Moseley and Valentin Bickel, and are key to
          reliable resource mapping and landing‑site planning.  Students learn the basics of deep learning (MLPs,
          CNNs, U‑Nets, etc.) and then apply them to clean up PSR images using real training data.

        <h3>Current research</h3>
        <p>
          My PhD project aims to develop a single, differentiable pipeline that
          converts all available JWST observations of a hot Jupiter—thermal
          emission spectra, phase curves, eclipses and transmission spectra—into a
          unified three‑dimensional temperature field \(T(\lambda, \phi, p)\). The
          map uses a low‑dimensional spherical‑harmonics basis for horizontal
          structure and smooth vertical modes, and the inversion is regularised
          using physically motivated terms such as energy balance, global
          radiative closure and hydrostatic consistency.  This
          framework treats the atmosphere as a shared state that must
          simultaneously explain observations across multiple viewing geometries.

        <h3>Previous work</h3>
        <p>
          At the HomanLab in Zürich I explored how our brains follow the flow of stories.  Working with a
          language model, we distilled two simple signals: a <em>drift</em> signal that
          captures the gradual build‑up of meaning as a narrative unfolds, and a
          <em>shift</em> signal that spikes when the story moves to a new event or scene.
          When we compared these signals to high‑resolution fMRI recordings from a
          volunteer listening to crime stories, we found that the burst‑like
          shift signal lit up the brain’s speech and hearing centres, whereas the
          slow drift signal was strongest in the so‑called default‑mode network –
          regions like the angular gyrus, precuneus and posterior cingulate that
          support memory and imagination.  This pattern suggests that auditory
          areas mark event boundaries while broader networks follow the slow evolution
          of context.
        </p>

          Below are brain maps showing where each signal explained neural
          responses.  Bright colours indicate regions with stronger effects.

        <h3>Master’s thesis: Physics‑informed neural networks for seismology</h3>
        <p>
          During my master’s studies at ETH Zürich I investigated Physics‑Informed Neural
          Networks (PINNs) as a way to solve the elastic wave equation, which describes
          how seismic waves propagate through the Earth.  By embedding wave physics
          directly into the network architecture – for example using custom wavelet or
          plane‑wave layers along with encoder and decoder components – I achieved
          solutions that were roughly twice as accurate as standard PINNs.  I also conditioned the networks on the location of the seismic source, allowing them to infer the
          wavefield for countless source locations in a single forward pass and dramatically
          speeding up simulations compared with traditional finite‑difference methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          I presented this work at the 2024 British Seismology Meeting, and it was later summarised in
          <a href="https://academic.oup.com/astrogeo/article-abstract/66/3/3.29/8154308?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank"><em>Astronomy &amp; Geophysics</em></a>.  The report notes that incorporating wave physics improves
          accuracy and that once trained these networks are much faster than standard numerical solvers.
